# Supply chain blockchain project-for international retail company

Supply chain tracebility improvement with Ethereum blockchain testnet. Deployed with Metamask.

I was responsible for the stakeholders management and evaluation of potential contractors in order to understand whether the retailer should implement a blockchain-based solution to improve the supply chain tracebility process.

  * Wrote a smart contract to calculate approximate costs using Ethereum mainnet
  * Compared private and public blockchain solutions
  * Decided to abandon the project because of negative unit-economics and technology being immature in 2018 ~~even now it is:)~~
